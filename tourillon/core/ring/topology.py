    All mutations go through apply_member or merge_registry. Both methods
    compare the incoming Member against the current registry entry using
    member.supersedes() and, when the record is newer, update the registry
    and derive the necessary ring mutation from the observed phase transition
    entirely internally. Callers never manipulate the ring directly.

    Ring mutation rules applied automatically by apply_member:
      * → READY (from IDLE/JOINING)  : ring.add_vnodes; epoch++.
      DRAINING → IDLE                : ring.drop_nodes; epoch++.
      IDLE → JOINING                 : no ring change; no epoch change.
      Any other transition           : no ring change; epoch++.

    Snapshot contract: snapshot() acquires the lock, builds an immutable
    Topology from MemberRegistry.snapshot() and the current Ring, releases
    the lock, then returns the frozen Topology.

    member_fingerprint() is always read live from TopologyManager under its
    lock; it is never stored on a Topology snapshot, which would become
    immediately stale.
