    A single instance monitors exactly one peer and knows nothing about that
    peer's identity — identity management is the sole responsibility of
    ProbeManager. The detector models the distribution of heartbeat
    inter-arrival intervals and computes a phi value that grows the longer
    the peer has been silent.

    record_heartbeat() must be called each time a heartbeat arrives from the
    monitored peer. phi() and is_available() may be called at any time.

    The phi formula used is the exponential approximation from the original
    paper: phi(t) = t / (mean * ln(10)), which grows linearly with elapsed
    time and is zero before any heartbeat is recorded.
