"""SerializerPort — payload codec abstraction used throughout the core layer.

The core domain never imports msgpack directly. All encode/decode operations
go through this Protocol so that tests can inject a trivially-decodable stub
and future codecs (e.g. a JSON debug adapter) can be swapped per connection
without modifying any business logic.
