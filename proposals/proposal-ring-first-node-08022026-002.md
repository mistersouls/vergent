# Proposal: Ring & First-Node Bootstrap

**Author**: Souleymane BA <soulsmister@gmail.com>
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Sequence:** 002
**Schema version:** 2

---

## Summary

This proposal defines the consistent-hashing ring layer — `HashSpace`, `VNode`,
`Ring`, `Partitioner`, `PlacementStrategy`, and `TopologyManager` — and the
first-node bootstrap path that brings a single node from `IDLE` directly to
`READY` without seed contact, token-selection ceremony, or data transfer. It is
the foundational layer on which all subsequent proposals depend. After
implementing this proposal, the ring can be created, queried, and verified in
isolation, and a single node can reach `READY` by running `tourillon node start`
with no seeds configured.

---

## Motivation

Every routing, replication, and placement decision in Tourillon is a pure
function of the consistent-hashing ring. Before any node can join a cluster,
serve traffic, or exchange data, the ring primitives must be correct and
independently verifiable.

Isolating the ring layer into its own proposal means it can be proven correct
without a running cluster, gives every subsequent proposal a stable dependency,
and keeps each proposal self-contained and testable.

The first-node bootstrap is the simplest possible join scenario: no peers, no
data to transfer, no concurrency. It validates the `IDLE → READY` direct
transition and the epoch machinery against the ring layer before the seeded join
and gossip are introduced. The `JOINING` phase is reserved for the seeded-join
proposal where an incoming node must wait for partition data transfer before
serving traffic.

---

## CLI contract

### `tourillon node start` — first-node bootstrap

`tourillon node start` reads `config.toml`, acquires the exclusive process lock
(`pid.lock`), then drives the node lifecycle. The command accepts only these
phases at startup: `IDLE` and `READY`. Any other persisted phase is an error
and the process exits with code 1 before binding any socket.

#### Output conventions

`tourillon` is a daemon — it emits **zero terminal output** outside of the
Python `logging` subsystem. Every line the operator sees (progress, errors,
ready signal, shutdown) is a structured `logging` record routed through the
root logger. `setup_logging()` (`tourillon/bootstrap/log.py`) is the first call
in every Typer command and configures the root logger with the format below:

```
%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s [%(name)s:%(funcName)s] %(message)s
```

with `datefmt="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`. The log level defaults to `INFO` and can
be overridden via `--log-level DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR`.

`Console.print()` and `print()` are forbidden everywhere in `tourillon/`.

#### Accepted phases and their startup behaviour

| Persisted phase | Startup action |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `IDLE` (no seeds) | First-node bootstrap: `IDLE → READY`. Both `TcpServer` sockets are bound after `READY` is persisted. |
| `READY` | Crash-recovery restart: skip transition, rebuild topology from persisted state, bind both sockets. |
| Any other | `logger.error` + exit 1 before binding any socket. |

#### No seeds — first-node bootstrap

## Design

### Hash space

`HashSpace(bits: int = 128)` defines the circular integer domain `[0, 2**bits)`.

- In production: `bits=128`, giving 2^128 ≈ 3.4 × 10^38 positions.
- In tests: `bits=8` (256 positions) preserves every structural invariant while
  making property-based tests tractable.

**Hash function:** MD5, used exclusively for its 128-bit deterministic output.
Not a cryptographic primitive — all security is provided by mTLS. Output is
truncated to `bits` significant bits for `bits < 128`.

**Circular arithmetic:** all position arithmetic is `mod 2**bits`. Intervals are
half-open `(a, b]` with wrap-around: when `a ≥ b`, the interval crosses the
zero boundary (`h > a or h ≤ b`).

`HashSpace` is never a global singleton. It is instantiated once at cluster
bootstrap with a fixed `bits` value and injected into every component. Mixing
instances with different `bits` values in the same cluster is a configuration
error caught at startup.

### Virtual nodes

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class VNode:
    node_id: str
    token:   int   # ∈ [0, 2**bits)
```

A physical node contributes `node_size.token_count` vnodes to the ring
(`[node].size` in config: `XS`=1, `S`=2, `M`=4, `L`=8, `XL`=16, `XXL`=32;
fixed at cluster join time and immutable thereafter). `[node].size` expresses
intentional load capacity: a larger node owns more partitions and absorbs more
traffic proportionally, enabling mixed hardware tiers in the same cluster.

**Token selection:** tokens are chosen **randomly** at the start of the join
transition: `IDLE → READY` for the first-node path; `IDLE → JOINING` for the
seeded path (future proposal). They are persisted immediately and never
regenerated.

```
Before persisting the target phase:
  tokens = [secrets.randbelow(2**bits) for _ in range(token_count)]
  Persist tokens alongside the new phase in state.toml.
```

Tokens are generated exactly once, persisted immediately, and broadcast later
(seeded join proposal 007). Random placement gives a statistically uniform distribution
across the hash space with no correlation to node identity.

**Token uniqueness:** with `bits=128` the probability of any two tokens
colliding across an entire cluster is ~10⁻²⁸ — effectively impossible. No
collision-handling logic is specified or required. Tests use deterministic
tokens (not `secrets.randbelow`) to keep fixtures stable on the small
`bits=8` space.

### Ring

`Ring` is an **immutable sorted sequence** of `VNode` instances ordered by
ascending token. A coroutine holding a ring snapshot across an `await` can
never have it change underneath.

**Successor lookup — O(log n):**

```python
def successor(self, token: int) -> VNode:
    idx = bisect_right(self._vnodes, token, key=lambda v: v.token)
    if idx == len(self._vnodes):
        idx = 0   # wrap-around
    return self._vnodes[idx]
```

**Mutations return new Ring instances:**

```python
ring2 = ring.add_vnodes(new_vnodes)   # merge-sort, O(k log k + n)
ring3 = ring.drop_nodes({"node-3"})  # linear filter, O(n)
```

`ring.iter_from(vnode)` yields all vnodes in clockwise order from a given
position, wrapping at the end. Used by `PlacementStrategy` and rebalance.

### Partitioner and logical partitions

`Partitioner(hash_space, partition_shift)` imposes a **static, fixed-size grid**
of `2**partition_shift` logical partitions over the ring. This grid is
independent of physical nodes and never changes when topology changes.

```
total_partitions = 2 ** partition_shift
step             = hash_space.max >> partition_shift
pid              = h >> (bits - partition_shift)   # O(1)
```

`partition_shift` is fixed for the lifetime of the cluster. Choose
conservatively:

| Max node count | Min `partition_shift` | Total partitions |
|---------------:|---------------------:|-----------------:|
| 100            | 10                   | 1 024            |
| 1 000          | 14                   | 16 384           |
| 10 000         | 17                   | 131 072          |

For tests with `bits=8`, `partition_shift` must be strictly less than 8.
Enforced at construction time.

`LogicalPartition` is a contiguous half-open arc `(start, end]` of the circular
hash space. Its `pid` is a stable storage-key prefix that survives ring
mutations.

`PartitionPlacement` is an **ephemeral** binding between a `LogicalPartition`
and its current owner `VNode`. It is never persisted. After any ring mutation,
placements for affected partitions must be recomputed.

`Partitioner.placement_for_token(token, ring)` is the primary routing entry
point: O(1) partition lookup followed by O(log n) ring successor lookup.

### Placement strategy and preference list

```python
class PlacementStrategy(Protocol):
    async def preference_list(
        self,
        placement: PartitionPlacement,
        topology: Topology,
        probe_manager: "ProbeManager",
    ) -> list[PreferenceEntry]: ...
```

`SimplePreferenceStrategy(rf: int)` — default implementation:

1. Start from `placement.vnode`.
2. Walk clockwise via `topology.ring.iter_from`, deduplicating by `node_id`.
3. Stop when `rf` canonical positions are collected or the full ring is exhausted.
4. Record the last vnode token reached (`last_token`) — this is the start point for the handoff walk in step 6.
5. For each collected member, build a `PreferenceEntry` based on phase and probe state:
   - `READY`,    probe LIVE    → `PreferenceEntry(readable=True,  suspect=False, handoff=None)`
   - `READY`,    probe SUSPECT → `PreferenceEntry(readable=True,  suspect=True,  handoff=other.node_id)`
   - `DRAINING`, probe LIVE    → `PreferenceEntry(readable=True,  suspect=False, handoff=other.node_id)`
   - `DRAINING`, probe SUSPECT → `PreferenceEntry(readable=True,  suspect=True,  handoff=other.node_id)`
   - `PAUSED`,   probe LIVE    → `PreferenceEntry(readable=False, suspect=False, handoff=other.node_id)`
   - `PAUSED`,   probe SUSPECT → `PreferenceEntry(readable=False, suspect=True,  handoff=other.node_id)`
6. For each entry that requires a handoff, continue the clockwise walk from `last_token`, advancing `last_token` after each selection. Skip any `node_id` already used as a primary or handoff target. The walk is bounded to one full circle; if no eligible candidate remains, set `handoff=None`. The caller decides how to handle a `None` handoff (degrade, error, etc.) — this behaviour is defined in the seeded join proposal.

Every `node_id` — whether it appears as `PreferenceEntry.node_id` (primary
position) or as `PreferenceEntry.handoff` (temporary handoff target) — must
appear **at most once** across the entire preference list. A node that is
already a primary replica must not also be a handoff target, and vice versa.
This uniqueness invariant ensures that every write fan-out reaches a distinct
physical node, preserving the replication guarantee.


Phase eligibility:

| Phase | Readable (reads) | Handoff for writes | Reason |
|-------|:---:|:------------------:|--------|
| `IDLE` | No | No | No data; not participating. |
| `JOINING` | No | No | Incomplete snapshot; excluded from routing. |
| `READY` | Yes | When SUSPECT | Fully operational; hinted handoff reserved when the failure detector suspects this node. |
| `PAUSED` | No | Yes | Remains in ring to allow resynchronisation on resume; does not serve reads. |
| `DRAINING` | Yes | Yes | Counts toward reads; writes redirected to handoff target. |
| `FAILED` | No | No | Inert. |

The preference list is a **deterministic function** of `(placement, topology, probe_manager)`:
identical inputs always produce identical outputs. No wall-clock time is permitted
while constructing the list.

`SimplePreferenceStrategy` receives a `ProbeManager` instance and awaits its query
methods (`is_suspect`, `state_of`, etc.) while walking the ring. It must not
trigger probes; probes are started externally by the operation layer when a peer fails.

`ProbeManager` is a **domain class** that manages one `FailureDetector` instance per
actively observed peer. It is the single source of truth on local reachability for
the rest of the domain. Each `FailureDetector` tracks heartbeat inter-arrival times
for exactly one peer; `ProbeManager` maps `node_id → FailureDetector` and translates
`phi()` into a `MemberState` value. `MemberState` has three values: `LIVE`,
`SUSPECT`, `UNKNOWN`.

### Member registry

**`MemberRegistry`** is a pure key-value store (`node_id → Member`). It handles
insertion and lookup only. It carries no eviction policy and no gossip
knowledge. `snapshot()` returns a shallow copy that is safe to iterate outside
the `TopologyManager` lock. Tombstone eviction (removing `FAILED` entries) is
out of scope for this proposal and belongs to the gossip proposal.

### Topology

`Topology` is an **immutable** point-in-time snapshot of the cluster topology.
It is safe to hold across `await` points. Obtained via
`TopologyManager.snapshot()`.

`TopologyManager` is the stateful manager. It owns a `MemberRegistry` held
under a single `asyncio.Lock` so that ring and registry are always mutated
atomically. The active routing ring contains the
vnodes of `READY`, `DRAINING`, `PAUSED`, and `FAILED` nodes. A `JOINING` node's
vnodes are stored in the registry but not incorporated into the routing ring
until the node reaches `READY`. A `PAUSED` node's vnodes remain in the ring so
that preference-list construction can include the node and reserve a handoff
target for resynchronisation on resume. A `FAILED` node's vnodes remain in the
ring but are skipped during preference-list construction — they are neither
readable nor eligible as handoff targets.

### Topology epoch

The **topology epoch** is a monotonically increasing integer stored as
`[topology].epoch` in `state.toml`. It is incremented on those phase
transitions that change routing eligibility or modify the active routing ring.
This makes the epoch a compact version identifier for the topology used by
routing and placement.

| Transition | Epoch advances? | Ring changes? |
|-----------|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| `IDLE → READY` (first node, no seeds) |       Yes       | Yes |
| `IDLE → JOINING` (seeded join — future proposal) |       Yes       |      No       |
| `JOINING → READY` |       Yes       |      Yes      |
| `JOINING → FAILED` |       Yes       |      No       |
| `READY → PAUSED` |       Yes       |      No       |
| `READY → DRAINING` |       Yes       |      No       |
| `DRAINING → IDLE` |       Yes       |      Yes      |
| `DRAINING → FAILED` |       Yes       |      No       |

`state.toml` is the single source of truth for the node's persistent lifecycle
state. It is always written atomically via `StatePort.save()`. The canonical
TOML format and the two reference snapshots are defined in `### Node state`
above.

`tokens` is written once at the start of the join transition (`IDLE → READY`
for the first node; `IDLE → JOINING` for seeded join) and never changes for the
lifetime of this join. `seq` advances by one on each phase transition. `epoch`
tracks the topology version and advances as specified in the epoch table above.

### First-node bootstrap sequence

Precondition: no seeds in `[cluster].seeds` and no `--seed` flags. The
persisted phase is `IDLE`.

```
1. IDLE → READY (single atomic transition — no intermediate JOINING):
   - Generate tokens: [secrets.randbelow(2**bits) for _ in range(token_count)].
   - Increment generation (→ 1 for a fresh node), set seq = 0.
   - Assign all total_partitions partitions to this node.
     (Pure function of a single-node ring — no seed contact, no transfer.)
   - Build NodeState(phase=READY, generation=1, seq=0, tokens, epoch=1).
   - Call StatePort.save(state) — atomic write + fsync before any socket is
     opened. No peer socket, no KV socket may be opened before save() returns.

2. TopologyManager: incorporate this node's vnodes into the routing ring.

3. Bind the peer TcpServer on [node].peer_address.
4. Bind the KV TcpServer on [node].kv_address.
   KV handlers (kv.put / kv.get / kv.delete) are registered by the data-plane
   layer; they are out of scope for this proposal. The KV socket is bound here
   so that the lifecycle invariant (KV socket ↔ phase READY) is established
   from the very first bootstrap.
```

No seed contact. No partition data transfer. No rebalance.

The `JOINING` phase is entirely absent from the first-node path. It exists
exclusively for the seeded-join flow (future proposal) where an incoming node
must wait for an authoritative partition snapshot before serving traffic.

`Member.generation` is incremented **exactly once** here. Any subsequent
crash-restart reuses the persisted generation unchanged.

### READY restart (crash-recovery)

When the node restarts with a persisted phase of `READY`, the bootstrap
sequence is:

```
1. Load NodeState from state.toml — phase=READY, epoch and tokens intact.
2. Rebuild TopologyManager from the persisted state (single-node: self only).
3. Bind the peer TcpServer on [node].peer_address.
4. Bind the KV TcpServer on [node].kv_address.
```

No state transition is executed. `epoch` and `generation` are unchanged.
This is a pure READY → READY path: the node resumes exactly where it stopped.

### Error paths

**Node already in a non-IDLE / non-READY phase:** `tourillon node start` reads
the current phase from `state.toml`. If the phase is not `IDLE` and not `READY`
(e.g. `JOINING`, `DRAINING`, or `PAUSED` left over from a previous run), the
process logs an error and exits with code 1 before binding any socket. Recovery
from those phases is defined in their respective proposals.

**Seeds configured:** If `[cluster].seeds` is non-empty, the process exits with
code 1 and an explanatory message. Seeded join is out of scope for this
proposal.

### Crash recovery semantics

The authoritative restart state is always read from `state.toml`. The node
never infers its phase from network observations or in-memory state.

| Phase at crash | Tokens persisted? | Restart behaviour |
|---|:---:|---|
| `IDLE` | No | Restart cleanly as `IDLE`. No generation is incremented; the node runs first-node bootstrap on the next `tourillon node start`. |
| `IDLE → READY` (crash before `state.toml` written) | No | `state.toml` was never written (or still holds the initial `IDLE` state). Restart as `IDLE`; re-execute first-node bootstrap from the top. Generation may be re-incremented on the next start. |
| `READY` | Yes | Restart in `READY`. Rebuild the `TopologyManager` from persisted state and resume responding on the peer socket. No state transition is executed. |
| `JOINING` (seeded join — future proposal) | Yes | Restart in `JOINING`. Reuse persisted `generation` and `tokens` unchanged — never re-increment generation or regenerate tokens. Re-attempt the `JOINING → READY` transition. |
| `DRAINING` | Yes | Restart in `DRAINING`. Resume the drain protocol from where it was interrupted (future proposal). |
| `PAUSED` | Yes | Restart in `PAUSED`. Remain paused until `tourctl node resume` is issued (future proposal). |

The critical invariant is the **write-before-announce** rule: because
`StatePort.save()` completes (including fsync) before any gossip or topology
announcement is emitted, a crash between the write and the announcement is
safe — the node restarts with the correct phase and re-emits the announcement
on the next boot. A crash *before* `save()` leaves disk in its previous state,
so the node restarts one phase earlier and re-executes the transition from
scratch.

---

## Core invariants

- The ring is a **pure function** of the persisted registry. Two nodes with the
  same registry always derive the same ring, preference lists, and partition
  assignments.
- `partition_shift` is **immutable** after cluster bootstrap.
- `[node].size` is **immutable** after the node joins.
- **Vnode tokens are chosen randomly once** at the start of the join transition
  (`IDLE → READY` for the first node; `IDLE → JOINING` for seeded join) and then
  persisted. They are never regenerated on retry, crash-restart, or recovery.
- The **routing ring** incorporates a node's vnodes when that node reaches
  `READY`, and retains them as long as the node exists — regardless of whether
  it subsequently becomes `DRAINING`, `PAUSED`, or `FAILED`. Vnodes are removed
  only on `DRAINING → IDLE` (graceful leave). `JOINING` and `IDLE` nodes are
  never in the ring.
- Topology epoch **never regresses** and advances on every phase transition that
  changes routing eligibility or the active routing ring. `IDLE → JOINING` does
  not advance the epoch; `IDLE → READY` (first node) does.
- `TopologyManager` holds the ring and `MemberRegistry` under a single
  `asyncio.Lock`. They are always mutated atomically. Ring mutations are derived
  internally from the phase transition observed in `apply_member`; callers never
  touch the ring directly.
- `apply_member` returns `True` if the registry or ring was modified, `False`
  for no-ops.
- `PartitionPlacement` is **ephemeral**: never persisted; always recomputed
  after ring mutation.
- `Member.generation` is incremented **exactly once** per join lifecycle, at
  the start of the join transition. Never on crash-restart or retry.
- The node state file is **always written before any socket is opened** for any
  phase transition. The peer `TcpServer` is bound only after `StatePort.save()`
  returns successfully.

## Design decisions

**MD5 as the hash function.**
MD5 is chosen exclusively for its 128-bit deterministic output and universal
availability. It is not used as a security primitive — mTLS provides all
security guarantees. Its speed and fixed output width make it a straightforward
choice for key distribution. Output is truncated to `bits` significant bits for
test instances with `bits < 128`.


**Random token placement.**
Tokens are generated with `secrets.randbelow(2**bits)` at the start of the join
transition (`IDLE → READY` for the first node; `IDLE → JOINING` for seeded
join). Random placement achieves a statistically uniform distribution across the
hash space with no correlation to node identity, avoiding hot-spots and natural
clustering that deterministic schemes (e.g. based on node name hash) introduce.

**Immutable `Ring`.**
`add_vnodes` and `drop_nodes` return new `Ring` instances and never mutate the
receiver. This makes it safe for a coroutine to hold a ring reference across
`await` points: the ring it operates on cannot change underneath it, eliminating
an entire class of race conditions without requiring additional locks.

**Fixed, topology-independent partition grid.**
`Partitioner` imposes a static grid of `2**partition_shift` partitions whose
boundaries are fixed for the lifetime of the cluster. Partition IDs become
stable storage-key prefixes that survive ring mutations entirely. When a node
leaves and another takes over a partition, the underlying keys do not need to be
renamed; only ownership changes.

**`partition_shift < bits` enforced at construction.**
If `partition_shift == bits` every hash would map to a different partition for
each possible bit value, producing a meaningless grid. More practically, the
constraint prevents the degenerate case where all positions collapse. Validation
at construction time surfaces misconfiguration at startup rather than silently
producing incorrect routing.

**Epoch does not advance on `IDLE → JOINING`.**
A `JOINING` node does not participate in the active routing ring and serves no
traffic. Incrementing the epoch at this transition would cause peers that observe
the epoch to believe the active topology has changed and trigger unnecessary
reconfigurations. The epoch advances only when routing eligibility or the active
ring actually changes, keeping the epoch a meaningful compacted version of the
routing state. For the first-node path (`IDLE → READY`), the epoch advances to 1
immediately because the node enters the ring directly.

**`IDLE → READY` directly for the first-node path.**
A node joining a cluster for the first time via the seeded path must pause in
`JOINING` until it has received and applied a complete partition snapshot from
the donor node. The first-node path has no donor and no data to receive, so the
pause is unnecessary and the node can transition directly from `IDLE` to `READY`.
Keeping `JOINING` absent from the seedless path eliminates a transient state that
has no observable meaning, simplifies the bootstrap sequence, and makes the CLI
output reflect only states the operator needs to act on.

**`FailureDetector` and `ProbeManager` are domain classes, not infra ports.**
The phi-accrual algorithm, probe lifecycle rules, and threshold computation are
business logic — they determine how the cluster reasons about peer health and
influence routing decisions directly. Placing them in `core/` makes them
testable in isolation: tests call `record_heartbeat` and `record_miss` directly
without any real network calls.

**`FailureDetector` is node-id-agnostic.**
A `FailureDetector` instance models the heartbeat inter-arrival distribution for
exactly one peer and knows nothing about that peer's identity. This keeps the
statistical model pure and makes it trivially unit-testable. `ProbeManager` is
the only place where node identities are associated with detector instances; it
creates one `FailureDetector` per `node_id` on first observation and maps
`phi()` to a `MemberState` value.

**`MemberState` is distinct from `MemberPhase`.**
`MemberState` (`LIVE`, `SUSPECT`, `UNKNOWN`) is a private, per-observer
judgement derived locally from `FailureDetector.phi()` and is never gossiped.
`MemberPhase` is the node's own self-declared state broadcast via gossip. Keeping
them as separate types prevents callers from confusing local suspicion with
cluster-wide membership state.

**`TopologyManager` exposes only member-centric mutations.**
Exposing ring-level operations (`add_vnode`, `drop_from_ring`, …) would force
callers to know which ring mutation corresponds to each phase transition,
distributing that mapping logic across the codebase. `apply_member` and
`merge_registry` centralise it: callers hand in a `Member` record and the
manager derives the ring delta internally by diffing old vs. new phase.

**`MemberRegistry` is a pure key-value store.**
Mixing storage and eviction policy in the same type would embed gossip-engine
semantics inside a data structure, making it impossible to test the storage layer
in isolation. `MemberRegistry` is a pure `node_id → Member` store with no
knowledge of gossip rounds or eviction, keeping it trivially unit-testable.
Tombstone eviction belongs to the gossip proposal.

**`apply_member` returns `bool`.**
Returning `True` when the registry or ring changed allows the gossip engine to
decide in O(1) whether to queue a re-broadcast for this record, without taking a
second snapshot and comparing topologies. A `False` return means the record was
a no-op and can be silently dropped.

**Single `asyncio.Lock` in `TopologyManager`.**
Ring and registry must be mutated atomically. A dedicated lock per field would
allow a snapshot to observe a ring that already contains a new node's vnodes
while the registry still shows that node as `JOINING` — an inconsistent state
that would corrupt preference-list computation. A single lock eliminates this
class of inconsistency.

**`PartitionPlacement` is ephemeral.**
Persisting placements would introduce a second source of truth that could diverge
from the ring after a crash or an unclean shutdown. Always recomputing placement
from the current ring guarantees that the result is consistent with the persisted
registry, which is the single authoritative source.

**`Member.generation` increments exactly once per join lifecycle.**
Generation identifies a logical join attempt. If generation were incremented on
retry or crash-restart, peers that have already observed `generation=1` for a
node would receive a `generation=2` gossip record for what is logically the same
join, breaking convergence: they would treat it as a newer incarnation and accept
stale data as fresh. Reusing the persisted generation preserves the invariant
that a higher generation always means a newer join lifecycle. For the first-node
path, generation is incremented at the single `IDLE → READY` transition;
for seeded join it is incremented at `IDLE → JOINING`.

**`preference_list` is `async`.**
`ProbeManager` query methods are protected by an async lock because the
detector's per-peer state can be updated concurrently by the transport layer.
Making `preference_list` async allows the strategy to read the most current
`MemberState` atomically without requiring a separate snapshot step that could
introduce a TOCTOU gap.

**`StatePort` abstracts durable state I/O.**
The bootstrap sequence and phase-transition code call `StatePort.save()` rather
than writing TOML directly. This keeps all filesystem and encoding details inside
`FileStateAdapter` in `infra/`, preserving the hexagonal boundary: `core/` never
imports `tomllib`, `pathlib`, or `os`. Tests inject an in-memory `StatePort` stub
that records `save()` calls and returns canned `load()` results, making the full
bootstrap sequence testable without touching the filesystem.

**`FileStateAdapter` is the sole writer of `state.toml`.**
Designating a single component as the writer guarantees that writes are always
atomic (temp file + `os.replace()`) and eliminates the risk of concurrent writers
corrupting the file.

**`NodeState` is the single in-memory view of `state.toml`.**
Decoding the entire file into one frozen dataclass rather than reading individual
fields from a raw dict makes the state an explicit value that can be passed,
logged, tested, and compared without re-reading the file.

**`TopologyManager.snapshot()` acquires the lock, constructs an immutable
`Topology`, then releases.**
The returned `Topology` dataclass is frozen and captures both
`MemberRegistry.snapshot()` and the current `Ring` at the same logical instant.
Callers may hold it across `await` points without re-acquiring the lock. Any
subsequent mutation of the `TopologyManager` produces a new `Topology` and never
modifies the one already returned.

## Test scenarios

All scenarios run with in-memory adapters unless marked `[e2e]`.

| # | Fixture | Action | Expected |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `Ring(bits=8)`, 3 nodes 2 vnodes each | `add_vnodes(new_vnodes)` | Returns new `Ring`; original unchanged; result contains all former + new vnodes sorted ascending |
| 2 | `Ring(bits=8)`, 3 nodes | `drop_nodes({"node-3"})` | New ring without node-3 vnodes; original unchanged |
| 3 | `Partitioner(bits=8, ps=4)`, 3 independent ring instances with same state | `placement_for_token` for 100 tokens | All 3 return identical `PartitionPlacement` for every token |
| 4 | `bits=8` | `Partitioner(hs, 8)` | Raises `ValueError` (partition_shift must be < bits) |
| 5 | 5-node topology: A=READY, B=JOINING, C=READY, D=DRAINING, E=PAUSED; all reachable; `rf=3` | `preference_list` | A, C, D readable; E present in PL with `readable=False`; B absent |
| 6 | Same topology; probe marks C as SUSPECT | `preference_list` | A and D readable; one `PreferenceEntry(handoff="C")` emitted; C marked suspect; no node_id appears more than once across the full list |
| 7 | `TopologyManager`, node B JOINING | `apply_member(member_b_ready)` | Returns `True`; snapshot ring includes B's vnodes; `epoch` advanced by 1 |
| 8 | `TopologyManager`, node B READY | `apply_member(member_b_ready)` again (same record) | Returns `False`; snapshot unchanged |
| 9 | In-memory node, `IDLE`, no seeds | `run_first_node_bootstrap()` | Phase transitions directly to `READY` (no intermediate `JOINING`); `epoch==1`; `generation==1`; all partitions assigned; peer `TcpServer` started |
| 10 | In-memory node, `READY` | `run_first_node_bootstrap()` | Raises `BootstrapError(exit_code=1)`; error "node is already READY — nothing to do"; generation and epoch unchanged |
| 11 | In-memory node, `JOINING` | `run_first_node_bootstrap()` | Raises `BootstrapError(exit_code=1)`; error "unexpected phase JOINING — use seeded-join recovery" |
| 12 | (Hypothesis) arbitrary `add_vnodes` + `drop_nodes` on `bits=8` | Any sequence | `ring.successor(t)` always returns a vnode present in the ring; `len(ring)` = total surviving vnodes |
| 13 | `MemberRegistry.snapshot()` | Mutate original registry after taking snapshot | Snapshot is unaffected |
| 14 | `MemberRegistry` with A=READY, B=DRAINING | `members_in_phase(READY, DRAINING)` | Returns `{"A": member_a, "B": member_b}`; JOINING/IDLE/FAILED members absent |
| 15 | `merge_registry` atomicity | `merge_registry(registry_with_5_new_members)` | A `snapshot()` taken immediately after contains all 5 new members; no intermediate snapshot can observe a partial merge |
| 16 | `FileStateAdapter`, no file on disk | `load()` | Returns `None` |
| 17 | `FileStateAdapter`, valid `state.toml` with `phase=ready` | `load()` | Returns `NodeState(phase=READY, generation=1, seq=1, tokens=(14,87), epoch=1)` |
| 18 | `FileStateAdapter` | `save(NodeState(...))` then `load()` | Round-trip: loaded state equals saved state |
| 19 | In-memory `StatePort` stub | `save()` called from bootstrap sequence | Stub records exactly **one** `save()` call: with `phase=READY`, `epoch=1`, `generation=1` |
| 20 | `FileStateAdapter`, simulate crash mid-write (temp file exists, `os.replace()` not called) | Open adapter fresh and call `load()` | Old state returned; temp file is ignored; no StateError |

## Exit criteria

- [ ] All test scenarios pass.
- [ ] `uv run pytest -m ring` passes with zero failures.
- [ ] `FileStateAdapter` round-trip test passes (`save` → `load` returns identical `NodeState`).
- [ ] Bootstrap sequence uses `StatePort` exclusively; no direct file I/O in `core/`.
- [ ] `tourillon node start` (no seeds) → `READY` in one terminal session with a single `StatePort.save()` call; no `JOINING` state is ever persisted.
- [ ] `READY` restart path covered: node starts in `READY`, peer `TcpServer` is bound, no state transition is executed.
- [ ] `generation==1` after first-node bootstrap; calling `run_first_node_bootstrap()` a second time raises `BootstrapError` without mutating state.
- [ ] Property-based tests pass for arbitrary ring mutation sequences on `bits=8`.
- [ ] `uv run pytest --cov-fail-under=90` passes.
- [ ] `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` passes.

## Out of scope

Seeded join, gossip protocol, membership fetch, partition data transfer,
rebalance, retry/deadline model, `FAILED → JOINING` recovery, and
`tourctl node join` (requires a running peer mTLS listener — deferred to the
seeded-join proposal). All these belong to dedicated proposals.
