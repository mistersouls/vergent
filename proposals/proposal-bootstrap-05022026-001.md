## Summary

Before a Tourillon node can run, three things must exist: a Certificate
Authority, a signed server certificate embedded in a node config file, and a
signed client certificate embedded in an operator context file. This proposal
defines the `tourillon pki ca`, `tourillon config generate`, and
`tourillon config generate-context` commands, the TOML config format, the mTLS
dual-endpoint model, and the low-level transport layer (envelope framing,
dispatcher, TCP server). Everything that follows in
the system — node startup, KV operations, inter-node gossip — depends on the
artifacts this proposal produces.

---

## Motivation

Distributed systems often fail because certificate management is an afterthought.
Tourillon makes it impossible to run without mTLS: there is no plaintext
fallback, no self-signed workaround at connection time, and no separate cert
file paths to lose track of. Every artifact is produced by a single command and
stored inline in the relevant TOML file. An operator who follows the workflow
below cannot accidentally skip TLS.

The config format must also be fully self-contained so that copying a config
file to another machine is sufficient to run the node — no sidecar cert files,
no environment-specific paths, no hidden dependencies.

---

## CLI contract

### `tourillon pki ca`

Creates a new Certificate Authority (self-signed root). The private key is
written at mode `0600`.

```
$ tourillon pki ca \
    --out-cert ./ca.crt \
    --out-key  ./ca.key

✓ CA certificate written to ./ca.crt
✓ CA private key written to ./ca.key  (mode 0600)
```

Error — `--out-cert` / `--out-key` path not writable:

```
$ tourillon pki ca --out-cert /root/ca.crt --out-key /root/ca.key
✗ Cannot write to /root/ca.crt: permission denied
  exit code 1
```

### `tourillon config generate`

Issues a new server certificate signed by the supplied CA and writes a fully
populated `config.toml` containing the certificate, key, and CA inline as
base64-encoded PEM. The output file is written at mode `0600`.

```
$ tourillon config generate \
    --ca-cert  ./ca.crt \
    --ca-key   ./ca.key \
    --node-id  node-1 \
    --size     M \
    --kv-bind  0.0.0.0:7700 \
    --peer-bind 0.0.0.0:7701 \
    --out ./node-1.toml

✓ Certificate issued for node-1
✓ Config written to ./node-1.toml (mode 0600)
```

`--size` accepts `XS`, `S`, `M` (default), `L`, `XL`, `XXL`.

Error — `--ca-cert`/`--ca-key` missing:

```
$ tourillon config generate --node-id node-1 ...
✗ --ca-cert and --ca-key are required.
  exit code 1
```

Error — expired CA supplied:

```
$ tourillon config generate --ca-cert ./old-ca.crt --ca-key ./old-ca.key ...
✗ CA certificate expired on 2025-01-01. Generate a new CA first.
  exit code 1
```

Error — cert/key mismatch:

```
$ tourillon config generate --ca-cert ./ca.crt --ca-key ./wrong.key ...
✗ CA private key does not match CA certificate public key.
  exit code 1
```

### `tourillon config generate-context NAME`

Issues a client certificate signed by the supplied CA and writes a named
context entry in the specified `contexts.toml` file. The context bundles the
cluster CA, one or both endpoint addresses, and the client credential. Writing
is atomic (temp file + `os.replace`) to protect against mid-write crashes.

`--out` is required: the destination file must be stated explicitly so that
the operator is always aware of where credentials are written.

```
$ tourillon config generate-context prod \
    --ca-cert ./ca.crt \
    --ca-key  ./ca.key \
    --kv   kv.prod.example.com:7700 \
    --peer peer.prod.example.com:7701 \
    --out  ~/.config/tourillon/contexts.toml

✓ Client certificate issued
✓ Context "prod" written to ~/.config/tourillon/contexts.toml
```

To switch the active context after creation, use `tourctl config use-context`:

```
$ tourctl config use-context staging
✓ Active context set to "staging"
```


### Config file format (`config.toml`)

```toml
schema_version = 1   # bumped on incompatible format changes; checked at startup

[node]
id       = "node-1"
size     = "M"         # XS=1 | S=2 | M=4 | L=8 | XL=16 | XXL=32 tokens; immutable after join
data_dir = "./node-data"   # directory for state.toml, pid.lock, and transfer logs
                           # may differ across restarts; defaults to config file directory

[tls]
cert_data = "<base64-encoded PEM server cert>"
key_data  = "<base64-encoded PEM private key>"
ca_data   = "<base64-encoded PEM CA cert>"

[servers.kv]
bind      = "0.0.0.0:7700"
advertise = "kv.prod.example.com:7700"   # optional; defaults to bind
# Additional options (TLS tuning, timeouts, …) may be added in future proposals.

[servers.peer]
bind      = "0.0.0.0:7701"
advertise = "peer.prod.example.com:7701"

[cluster]
seeds           = ["node-2.example.com:7701", "node-3.example.com:7701"]
rf              = 3
partition_shift = 10   # log₂(total_partitions); immutable after cluster bootstrap

[join]
max_retries     = -1    # -1 = unlimited within deadline; set to N for a hard attempt cap
attempt_timeout = "10s" # per-attempt timeout (seed contact, single transfer batch)
deadline        = "120s"
backoff_base    = "2s"
backoff_max     = "30s"
max_concurrent  = 4     # max parallel partition transfers

[drain]
max_retries        = -1     # -1 = unlimited within deadline
attempt_timeout    = "30s"
deadline           = "300s"
backoff_base       = "5s"
backoff_max        = "60s"
max_concurrent     = 4
bandwidth_fraction = 1.0    # fraction of link bandwidth; 1.0 = unlimited
```

The file is read once at startup, validated, then discarded.

### Contexts file format (`contexts.toml`)

```toml
current-context = "prod"

[[contexts]]
name = "prod"

[contexts.cluster]
name    = "prod"
ca_data = "<base64-encoded PEM CA cert>"

[contexts.endpoints]
kv   = "kv.prod.example.com:7700"
peer = "peer.prod.example.com:7701"

[contexts.credentials]
cert_data = "<base64-encoded PEM client cert>"
key_data  = "<base64-encoded PEM client key>"
```

### Four-level config precedence

`CLI flag > environment variable > config file > built-in default`

A value at a higher level always shadows the corresponding value at a lower
level.

### Process lock

On startup, before any socket is bound, the process acquires an exclusive lock
on `<data_dir>/pid.lock` (file-based, non-blocking `fcntl.LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB`
on POSIX, `LockFileEx` on Windows). A second `tourillon` process targeting the
same `data_dir` will fail immediately:

```
✗ Another tourillon process is already running for data_dir "./node-data"
  (pid.lock held). Remove stale lock or choose a different data_dir.
  exit code 1
```

The process lock is held for the entire lifetime of the process. Crash recovery
works automatically: the OS releases the lock when the process dies.

`pid.lock` content: `{"pid": <int>, "started_at": "<ISO-8601>"}` — informational
only; the lock validity is determined by the OS file lock, not the content.

### Dual-endpoint model

Each node exposes two independent TCP listeners:

| Listener | Purpose | Who connects |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `servers.kv` | KV data-plane traffic: `put`, `get`, `delete` | Application clients, load balancers |
| `servers.peer` | Inter-node traffic (gossip, replication, handoff) + `tourctl` operator commands | Peer nodes, operators |

Both listeners use the same server certificate (node identity) but have
separate `ssl.SSLContext` instances and can enforce separate CA trust anchors.
This allows firewalling the KV plane from the peer plane and issuing separate
client certificate pools for applications vs. operators.

### Transport layer

Every connection — KV or peer — is framed using the `Envelope` wire format.
All multi-byte integer fields are big-endian.

```
 offset   bytes   field
 ──────   ─────   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 0        1       proto_version   uint8      current = 1
 1        2       schema_id       uint16     payload codec (1 = MessagePack)
 3        16      correlation_id  bytes[16]  UUID v4 (raw); request/response pairing
 19       4       payload_len     uint32     byte length of payload (M)
 23       1       kind_len        uint8      byte length of kind (N); 1 … KIND_MAX_LEN
 24       N       kind            UTF-8      envelope kind string
 24+N     M       payload         bytes      opaque; decoded per schema_id
```

**Constants:**
- `PROTO_VERSION = 1`
- `KIND_MAX_LEN = 64`  (UTF-8 bytes, not characters)

**Field semantics:**
- `proto_version` — allows protocol evolution; a receiver that does not
  support the version closes the connection immediately.
- `schema_id` — identifies the payload codec. `0` = raw bytes (no codec);
  `1` = MessagePack (default). Additional values reserved for future codecs
  (e.g. JSON for debugging). The core layer never hard-codes a codec; it
  delegates to a `SerializerPort`.
- `correlation_id` — a UUID v4 generated by the sender; carried unchanged in
  the response envelope. Enables async multiplexing: multiple in-flight
  request/response pairs on one connection without per-kind state.
- `kind` — identifies the message type (e.g. `kv.put`, `node.join`,
  `rebalance.transfer`). An envelope with an unknown `kind` causes immediate
  connection close; there is no error response.
- `payload` — opaque bytes; structure defined per `kind` and decoded using
  the codec indicated by `schema_id`.

The server component wraps `asyncio.start_server` with a mandatory mTLS
`ssl.SSLContext`. There is no cleartext fallback. The `Dispatcher` routes
envelopes to registered `ConnectionHandler` callables by `kind`. Handlers are
registered at startup and never modified at runtime.

**KV listener lifecycle:** the KV TCP socket is bound and accepting connections
only when `phase = READY`. In every other phase the socket is closed; clients
that attempt to connect will receive a TCP connection refusal at the OS level.
There is no application-level error response — the connection simply does not
exist.

### TCP client

Every outgoing connection — from `tourctl`, an application client, or a peer
node — uses the same `Envelope` framing as the server-side transport. A single
class, `TcpClient`, covers all use cases: one-shot commands (`tourctl kv get`)
and persistent multiplexed connections (gossip, replication, rebalance).

#### Connection model

`TcpClient` opens one mTLS connection and runs a background read loop that
delivers incoming envelopes to the correct caller by matching `correlation_id`.
The connection stays open for as long as the caller holds the client instance.
Callers that need only one round-trip should call `close()` immediately after
receiving the response; callers that send many requests (gossip, rebalance)
keep the connection alive.

#### Request patterns

| Method | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `request(env, timeout)` | Exactly one response is expected (kv.get, kv.put, kv.delete, node.inspect, …) |
| `stream(env, timeout)` | The server sends N progress envelopes followed by a terminal envelope (node.join, rebalance.transfer.init, …). The caller iterates until it chooses to stop. |

Both methods share the same `correlation_id` mechanism: the client generates a
UUID v4, writes it into the request envelope, and the server copies it
unchanged into every response envelope for that request. The read loop routes
each incoming envelope to the `Future` or `AsyncGenerator` registered for that
`correlation_id`.

#### Timeouts

`RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` is a per-request deadline, measured from the moment the
request envelope is sent. If no matching response arrives within
`RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` seconds, `request()` raises `ResponseTimeoutError` and the
`correlation_id` is deregistered; the connection stays open for other
in-flight requests. `stream()` applies the same timeout to each individual
envelope in the sequence.

`READ_TIMEOUT` is a per-read deadline on the transport: the time allowed to
receive a complete envelope (header + kind + payload) once at least one byte
has arrived. Exceeding it closes the connection.

#### Limits (enforced server-side)

The server tracks the number of distinct in-flight `correlation_id`s per
connection. When that count reaches `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_CONN`, the server
closes the connection immediately and emits a structured log event. The client
receives `ConnectionClosedError` on all pending requests.

`MAX_PAYLOAD_DEFAULT` is a global hard limit on every `Envelope` payload.
The server validates `payload_len` from the fixed header before allocating any
buffer. A violation causes the server to send an error response with
`kind=error.payload_too_large` and the original `correlation_id`, then close.

#### Production constants

| Constant | Default | Enforced by |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEFAULT` | 4 MiB | Server (connection closed after error response) |
| `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_CONN` | 128 | Server (connection closed) |
| `RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` | 30 s | Client (`ResponseTimeoutError`; connection stays open) |
| `READ_TIMEOUT` | 30 s | Server and client (connection closed) |

### Core invariants

- All certificate and key material stored inline as base64-encoded PEM
  exclusively. No `*_file` path variants anywhere.
- Both config files written at mode `0600` because both embed private key
  material.
- `tourillon.bootstrap.config.load_config` is the **only** code path that reads
  the config file or environment variables. All subsystems receive a
  `TourillonConfig` instance via constructor injection.
- `TourillonConfig` must be fully validated **before** any socket is bound,
  any file is opened, or any TLS context is created.
- The process lock on `<data_dir>/pid.lock` is acquired **before** any state
  file is read or written, ensuring no two processes can share the same
  `data_dir`.
- `tourctl` never reads or writes `config.toml` and never issues or stores
  certificates — it only reads and navigates `contexts.toml`.
- `contexts.toml` is never modified by a running `tourillon` node process.
- `[node].size` is immutable after the node joins a cluster. Changing it
  requires the node to leave, reconfigure, and re-join.
- `partition_shift` is immutable after cluster bootstrap. Changing it requires
  a full data migration (not supported).
- `schema_version` in `config.toml` is checked at startup. An unrecognised
  version causes an immediate startup failure with a clear error message.
- The core layer never imports `msgpack` directly. All payload
  serialisation/deserialisation goes through `SerializerPort`. The default
  infra adapter uses MessagePack with `schema_id = 1`.
- The KV TCP socket is bound **only when `phase = READY`**. A closed socket
  is the sole signal to callers that the node is not serving; there is no
  application-layer error or redirect.
- Every protocol violation on the receive path (bad `kind_len`, bad
  `payload_len`, unsupported `proto_version`) causes an immediate connection
  close after sending an error response. The server MUST read the full
  fixed-length header (24 bytes) before performing any validation so that the
  `correlation_id` is always available. After detecting a violation the server
  MUST send a single error response envelope carrying that `correlation_id`
  and a `kind` of the form `error.<event>` (e.g. `error.proto_version_unsupported`,
  `error.payload_too_large`), then close the connection. The client can
  therefore always correlate the error to its outstanding request.
  Exception: unknown `kind` closes the connection immediately without a
  response (the dispatcher has no handler to produce one).
- The receiver MUST validate `kind_len` and `payload_len` from the fixed header
  before allocating any buffer; `readexactly` is called only after validation.
- `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEFAULT` is a global limit applied to every `Envelope`
  regardless of `kind`. There are no per-kind payload limits.
- All traffic, including rebalance and snapshot transfers, travels inside
  `Envelope` messages. There are no out-of-band binary streams. Large logical
  payloads are split into multiple envelopes at the application layer.
- `TcpClient` MUST call `close()` during graceful shutdown; pending entries
  are failed with `ConnectionClosedError` if they cannot complete.

## Design

### Node size (`[node].size`)

Each node is assigned a **size class** that determines how many tokens
(virtual nodes) it claims on the consistent-hash ring. The size is set once at
`tourillon config generate` time and is **immutable** after the node joins a
cluster.

| Size | Tokens | Typical use |
|:----:|:------:|-------------|
| `XS` | 1 | Tiny / development node |
| `S` | 2 | Light workload |
| `M` | 4 | General purpose (default) |
| `L` | 8 | Higher-capacity node |
| `XL` | 16 | Large storage node |
| `XXL` | 32 | Maximum |

A heterogeneous cluster (nodes of different sizes) is fully supported. The
ring assigns proportionally more partitions to larger nodes.

## Design decisions

### Decision: inline base64 PEM — no file paths

**Alternatives considered:** `cert_file`, `key_file`, `ca_file` path references
in config (common in tools like nginx, etcd).
**Chosen because:** file paths create a dual-representation problem. The config
becomes invalid if the referenced file is moved, rotated, or absent in a
container. Inline material makes each config file fully self-contained: copying
it to another machine is sufficient. The cost — larger file size — is
negligible for certificates (a few KB).

### Decision: TOML over YAML

**Alternatives considered:** YAML with `PyYAML` or `ruamel.yaml`.
**Chosen because:** `tomllib` is stdlib (Python 3.11+); no additional runtime
dependency. TOML's strict native typing (integers, booleans, arrays) maps
directly onto the typed `TourillonConfig` dataclass and eliminates implicit-
coercion bugs (the YAML Norway problem, `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` booleans). The
only additional dependency is `tomli-w` for writing TOML, which has no
transitive dependencies.

### Decision: separate KV and peer listeners

**Alternatives considered:** single listener, `kind`-based routing to separate
planes.
**Chosen because:** independent listeners allow separate CA trust anchors,
separate network policies per plane, and separate client certificate pools.
Operating a KV-only client on the data plane does not require peer-plane
certificates, which reduces blast radius if a client credential is compromised.

### Decision: MessagePack as default codec behind a `SerializerPort`

**Alternatives considered:** JSON (human-readable), Protocol Buffers
(schema-first, backward-compatible version negotiation).
**Chosen because:** MessagePack is compact, fast, self-describing enough for
debugging (types are not erased), and requires no schema compilation step. JSON
overhead is significant at the per-envelope level for a high-throughput KV
store. Protobuf adds a schema compilation toolchain.

The **core layer never imports `msgpack` directly**. All codec work goes
through `SerializerPort` (a `Protocol`), and the default infra adapter
(`MsgpackSerializerAdapter`) hard-codes `schema_id = 1`. This inversion allows
tests to inject a trivially-decodable stub serializer without shipping msgpack
as a test dependency, and allows future codecs (e.g. a JSON debug adapter) to
be swapped per connection without modifying business logic.

## Test scenarios

| # | Fixture | Action | Expected |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Valid inline PEM config | `load_config(config_dict)` | Returns `TourillonConfig`; all fields correct; `node_size.token_count == 4` for `size="M"` |
| 2 | Config with expired server cert | `load_config` | `ConfigError` mentioning expiry; no socket bound |
| 3 | Config with cert/key mismatch | `load_config` | `ConfigError` mentioning mismatch |
| 4 | Config missing `[node].id` | `load_config` | `ConfigError` naming missing field |
| 5 | Config `[node].size = "HUGE"` | `load_config` | `ConfigError` listing valid values |
| 6 | `servers.kv.bind == servers.peer.bind` | Node startup | Startup fails; both addresses logged |
| 7 | In-memory dispatcher; unknown `kind` sent | Send `Envelope(kind="unknown")` | Connection closed; no application response |
| 8 | `Envelope` construction | `kind` of 65 UTF-8 bytes | `ValueError` at construction time |
| 9 | `Envelope` encoding/decoding round-trip | `encode → decode` via `MsgpackSerializerAdapter` | Decoded value equals original |
| 10 | `Envelope` with `proto_version=99` received | Server reads envelope | Server sends `kind=error.proto_version_unsupported` response with matching `correlation_id`, then closes |
| 11 | `correlation_id` in request envelope | Handler sends response | Response carries identical `correlation_id` |
| 12 | Node not `READY`; client attempts TCP connect to KV port | TCP connect | Connection refused at OS level; no application response |
| 13 `[e2e]` | Running node with mTLS; no client cert | Open TLS connection without client cert | TLS handshake fails; no application-level response |
| 14 `[e2e]` | Full provisioning session | `pki ca → config generate → config generate-context → tourctl config use-context` | All steps succeed; output files at mode 0600 |
| 15 | `TcpClient.request()` with valid mTLS | `request(env, timeout)` | Returns response with matching `correlation_id` |
| 16 | Server; `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_CONN` already reached on a connection | Client sends one more request | Server closes the connection; log `too_many_in_flight`; client receives `ConnectionClosedError` |
| 17 | Server receives envelope with `payload_len` > `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEFAULT` | Receive oversized envelope | Server sends `kind=error.payload_too_large` response with matching `correlation_id`, then closes; log `payload_too_large` |
| 18 | `TcpClient`; connection lost mid-flight | Outstanding `request()` awaiting response | Pending entry fails with `ConnectionClosedError` |
| 19 | `TcpClient.stream()` multi-response | `node.join` request yields 3 progress envelopes then a `.done` | All 4 envelopes delivered in order; caller terminates iteration on `.done` |
| 20 | `TcpClient.request()`; server never responds | Send request; server stays silent until `RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` | `ResponseTimeoutError` raised on the client; connection stays open |

## Exit criteria

- [ ] All test scenarios pass.
- [ ] `tourillon pki ca` → `tourillon config generate` → `tourillon config generate-context` → `tourctl config list` completes without error in a single terminal session.
- [ ] Connections without valid mTLS certificates are refused (no application-level response).
- [ ] All config and context files written at mode `0600`.
- [ ] `Envelope` round-trip (encode → wire → decode) preserves `kind`, `payload`, `correlation_id`, `schema_id`.
- [ ] KV TCP connect is refused when phase ≠ `READY`; returns no application response.
- [ ] `TcpClient.request()` round-trip preserves `correlation_id`.
- [ ] Server enforces `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_CONN`; exceeding it closes the connection and emits a `too_many_in_flight` log entry; client receives `ConnectionClosedError`.
- [ ] An oversized envelope payload causes the server to send an error response with matching `correlation_id` before closing; log entry `payload_too_large` emitted.
- [ ] `TcpClient.stream()` delivers all response envelopes in order until the caller terminates the iterator.
- [ ] A request whose `RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` expires raises `ResponseTimeoutError` on the client; the connection remains open.
- [ ] `uv run pytest --cov-fail-under=90` passes.
- [ ] `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
